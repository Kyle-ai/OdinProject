<!--Write a program that takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers from one to
the number the user entered.
However, for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for
the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both
three and five print FizzBuzz.-->

<!--when a user input
print 1 to input numbers
numbers that dive by 3 with no remainder print fizz
numbers that divide by 5 print buzz
divisible by both 5 and 3  print fizzBiz-->
